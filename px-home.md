# Welcome to the Portworx Documentation

Portworx provides scale-out storage for containers. Portworx storage is delivered as a container that gets installed on your servers. Portworx technology:

* Provides data protection and container-granular management.
* Enables companies to run multi-cloud with any scheduler.
* Manages storage that is directly attached to servers, from cloud volumes, or provided by hardware arrays.
* Is radically simple.

Portworx technology is available as PX-Enterprise and PX-Developer.

## PX-Enterprise
