Portworx provides scale-out storage for containers. Portworx storage is delivered as a container that is installed on your servers. Portworx technology:

* Provides data protection and container-granular management.
* Enables companies to run multi-cloud with any scheduler.
* Manages storage that is directly attached to servers, from cloud volumes, or provided by hardware arrays.
* Is radically simple.

Portworx technology is available as PX-Enterprise and PX-Developer.

## PX-Enterprise

PX-Enterprise is for DevOps and IT ops teams managing storage for containerized workloads. PX-Enterprise provides multi-cluster and multi-cloud support, where storage under management can be on-premise or in a public cloud like AWS.

* Scale-out storage deployed as a container
* Shared volumes, where multiple containers can share a single filesystem
* Container-granular controls
* Multi-cluster visibility and management
* Distributed file access
